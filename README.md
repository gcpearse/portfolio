# Portfolio

## Overview

My portfolio site, which can be visited [here](https://glen-pearse.netlify.app/), contains a selection of my recent projects.

For each entry I have included the tech stack used to build the application, along with a short description of the project. There is a link to the relevant GitHub repository and, where applicable, the live application.

For the site itself, I have focussed on creating a clean, minimalist aesthetic and an accessible user experience.
